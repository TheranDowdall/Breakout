# Breakout
Atari Breakout clone made in Java for a high school project.

Made using Java's AWT framework.

# Startup
This game can be downloaded from this repo and is compatable with Java11 and up.

To run this game, download it to an empty directory and run main.java, no extra libraries required!

# Game
This is classic Atari Breakout, you control a gray paddle found at the bottom of the screen, your goal is to break as many rainbow coloured bricks as possible.
Controls: A or Left Arrow to move the paddle left; D or Right Arrow to move the paddle right

By clearing all bricks, the game will reset and the level count will increase (top right corner).

After you play the game, if you obtain a highscore, the file Leaderboard.txt will be updated to reflect the local highscore.

# Customization
Entering Game.java, players can tweak the width and height of the game screen as well as the speed at which the game will take place. 
(Changing other variables is possible though not recommended :)).

# Known-Issues
Upon game startup, users will have to click the game window in order to move the paddle.
